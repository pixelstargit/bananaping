              <p>From designing a game that highlights the vulnerability of city dwellers to climate change to skating around the city, the ‘Serious Fun’ project has continued to engage practitioners, policy makers and academics in finding ways to address urban challenges through play</p>
              <p>Between 26 and 29 August, four groups of experts in the areas of climate change, food, mobility and education convened at UCT and at the new Skate Park in Gardens to explore ways of engaging the larger public at the upcoming City Desired Exhibition.</p>
              <p>As part of the exhibition, “Serious Fun”will explore the assumption that gaming and play can be means to develop alternative visions and uses of city spaces by experimenting at the intersection of playful participation, creative practice and serious urban issues. It will incorporate five thematic engagements through which these experiments will occur.</p>
              <h2>Metropoly Cape Town</h2>
              <p>The ACC in collaboration with participants from the Department of Spatial and Urban Design (City of Cape Town), CORC, PDG development consulting, Game Changers and a range of academics from UCT have been re-purposing Monopoly for Cape Town. The purpose of the new version is to critique cumulative advantage and disadvantage in the property market. The game has been renovated to fit the reality in Cape Town. Players start with differential economic positions, and the chance cards have been adapted to suit a range of South African realities. Metropoly: Cape Town will be played with high school learners, city officials, and exhibition audiences.</p>
              <h2>Playground: playful participatory planning</h2>
              <p>From designing a game that highlights the vulnerability of city dwellers to climate change to skating around the city, the ‘Serious Fun’ project has continued to engage practitioners, policy makers and academics in finding ways to address urban challenges through play</p>
              <h2>Food for thought</h2>
              <p>The ACC and dala are collaborating with other local organisations to develop a game / participatory public performance around food security in Cape Town. The purpose of the game is to engage different constituencies in a game that unpacks the food system in Cape Town. Players are expected to navigate a series of food security issues that are typical in South Africa. A series of actors will fill the roles of different food retailers, such as a street trader, farmer, and supermarket owner, and will act as facilitators of the game. The game / public performance will take place in Company Gardens as a backdrop to the history of food systems in Cape Town.</p>

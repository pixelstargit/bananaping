        <article class="title-block"><h2>About City Desired</h2></article>
        <p>Based on in-depth journalistic research, City Desired uses a range of media platforms, including photography, film and interactive tools, to profile ten Capetonians whose life experiences offer powerful insights into the fabric of the city. Drawing on the biographies of a domestic worker, taxi boss, psychiatrist, urban farmer, environmental officer, spaza shop owner, violence councilor, architect, school principal, and twin brothers who collaborate as artists, City Desired maps the fine grain of a city awkwardly negotiating change.While strongly focused on biography, the exhibition nonetheless offers the public a full- spectrum view of Cape Town’s many and complex challenges. Drawing on extensive research undertaken by ACC’s Citylab research programme, as well as research from within UCT and other institutions, City Desired is structured around ten key themes, each of which affects the city’s present and future livelihood. These core themes are Well- Being, Education, Mobility, Shelter, Work, The Food System, Land, Diversity, Vulnerability and Climate Change. <b>City Desired is curated by Tau Tavengwa and Edgar Pieterse, with Caroline Sohie.</b> <span class="icon plus">+</pan></p>
